# Description
This project creates a web client page which provieds users the ability to Create/Read/Update and Delete bookings in a bookings database. The web client interacts with a RESTful JAX-RS Web service which is deployed on a Apache Tomcat Server. The RESTful Web Service also acts as an RMI client to the RMI Database Server which will handle persistience and CRUD functionality of the database.
